  <b>The phrase “specialty coffee” was referred to coffee beans with the best flavour and growing conditions in an edition of ‘Tea & Coffee Trade Journal’. In today’s market, specialty coffee has become an intricate science and global phenomenon that is seeing rapid growth across all sectors.
When it comes to coffee quality, specialty coffee is the ‘cream of the crop’ and is likened to fine wines due to its distinctive characteristics and delicious flavour that can only be achieved under certain growing conditions.
The rise in specialty coffee culture is widely attributed to a growing number of artisan roasters and specialist independent coffee shops that are reinvigorating the coffee scene and leading the way into the fourth wave of coffee culture.</b></p>

  <h2><b>Growing & Processing<b></h2>
  <p> &#9728; Speciality coffee is grown at high altitudes, with much care and attention from the farmer.</p>
<p> &#9728; Each stage of the process needs to be carefully planned to ensure that the quality of the coffee is not jeopardised in any way.</p> 
<p> &#9728; Selective hand-picking of the beans is the best way to ensure that the beans are picked at their optimum ripeness.</p>
<p> &#9728; From there, it is sold at a premium to coffee traders, or direct to roasters.</p>
<p> &#9728; The roasters then create custom profiles for each coffee, enhancing and highlighting their natural flavours.</p>

  <h2><b>Coffee Grading<b></h2>
  <p> &#9728; Green coffee is graded via visual inspection and cupping. Visual inspection involves taking a 350g sample of green coffee beans and counting defective beans.</p>
<p> &#9728; To qualify as "specialty," a coffee must have zero primary faults and no more than five secondary defects, which can be either primary such black beans, sour beans or secondary such broken beans.</p> 
<p> &#9728; Cupping involves roasting the coffee and boiling it simply with hot water, and it relies on the taster's skill to assign values to each of the coffee's properties, such as acidity, body, flavour, and aroma.</p>
